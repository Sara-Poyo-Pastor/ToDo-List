# *Introduction* <img width = 50px, height = 50px src="https://github.com/nati-Bel/Proyecto-3---Music-App/assets/132446932/f963cbe0-2639-4950-81d2-6f41e4f9a7f5">
The main objective of this project is to introduce students to full stack web development using PHP and MySQL. It seeks to provide students with an opportunity to apply the concepts and techniques learned in a practical and relevant context. Through this project, students will gain experience in forms management, database queries, data validation and data manipulation.
# *Description of the project* <img width = 50px, height = 50px src="https://github.com/nati-Bel/Proyecto-3---Music-App/assets/132446932/53786f41-5b13-4265-a20d-a478d3aaff27">  
The project consists of the development of a functional task list web application. Users will be able to perform various actions, such as adding new tasks, editing their content or deleting them. The application will provide users with an efficient way to manage their tasks, allowing them to keep an organized and accessible record at all times.

Among the functional requirements of the application are task creation, where users will be able to add new tasks by providing a title and description. Users will also be able to view all existing tasks in a list. The application will also allow editing the title and description of existing tasks, as well as deleting tasks from the list.

      - private $password = '';
      - private $dbName = 'todo_list';
  - You must create a database in MYSQL with the name "todo_list".
  - Import in MYSQl the dump file named "tarea.sql".
